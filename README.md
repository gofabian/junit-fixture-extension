## todo

- [x] file scope
- [x] nested test classes
- [ ] fixtures in beforeXxx()/afterXxx()?
- [x] override fixture in higher scope?
- [ ] reference fixture by name (not only by type)
- [ ] @UseFixture
- [ ] readme
- [ ] support parallel execution
- [ ] support static fixture class methods
- [ ] fixture mark (given argument)
- [ ] parameterized fixture (multiple executions)
- [ ] more attributes in fixture context
- [ ] Programmatic FixtureDefinition
